### Stock market analysis based on the predicive Regression Models and Ensembles

Welcome to our hack repo!

Here is the overall guide for our project directories:

**Data/** The primary data we used for our analysis. The original stock.csv is excluded by .gitignore because its 1.7 GB size exceeds the limit.

**graphics/** All the data visualization files are stored here. Take a look at all the visual results we got! (The only things you can't see are the ones in html; in order to view them, you should clone our repo and open the html file in your browser. For convenience, we included screenshots of them in the demo directory.)

**src/** All the source codes for data analysis are here. All of them are written in R.

**webdev/** The directory for our website. If you would like to view the website, you should either clone our repo or go to demo directory for video recording.

**demo/** Screenshots and videos for demo.
